# CPU-Design-with-FSM-Control

Overview
This project focuses on extending the functionality of a CPU designed in Lab 5 by incorporating a Finite State Machine (FSM) controller. The FSM automates the process of setting control inputs to the datapath, enhancing the overall efficiency of instruction execution. Additionally, an instruction register is introduced to provide dynamic inputs to the FSM, allowing for more flexibility in register configuration during execution.

Key Features
FSM Controller Implementation:

Developed a FSM controller to automate control inputs to the datapath.
Streamlined the execution process by integrating FSM-based control.
Instruction Register:

Introduced an instruction register to provide dynamic inputs for register configuration during execution.
Enhanced programmability and flexibility in specifying registers for instruction execution.
ALU Operations:

Integrated Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) operations, including addition and logical operations.
Expanded the CPU's computational capabilities through the implementation of ALU instructions.
How to Run
Prerequisites:

Ensure that the Lab 5 CPU design is correctly implemented.
Building the Project:

Follow the steps outlined in Section 4 of the lab documentation to make the necessary changes to the existing design.
Simulation:

Utilize ModelSim or your preferred simulation tool to observe the FSM-controlled CPU behavior.
Testing:

Verify the correct execution of instructions and the interaction between the FSM controller and the datapath.
